# Semantic
This is a program 

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates semantic similarity analysis using the spaCy library. The script compares the similarity scores between different tokens using the pre-trained word vectors provided by the 'en_core_web_md' model. Semantic similarity analysis is a technique used to measure the similarity between words or phrases based on their meaning or context. It is commonly used in natural language processing tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, and recommendation systems.
